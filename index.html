					Hey there! My name is Talia Swartz. 
					I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. 
					I love front-end web development and bunnies. 
					I also love drawing stuff, primarily people and my shoes.
					The photo you see above is me hiking in Israel.
					It's the only cool photo of myself in existence.

				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					I was born to a spunky flamenco dancer and her stoic but tender-hearted bull-fighter husband in Barcelona.
					We lived above a convent and at night my father played guitar for us while my mother danced under the stars.
					<br/><br/>
					Pranked you! I was born in Palo Alto, CA.
					When I was 6 we moved to Baltimore, MD.
					Yes, <i>The Wire</i> was filmed there. And yes, I have seen <i>The Wire</i>.
					Have you seen <i>The Wire</i>? If not, you should.
					<br/><br/>
					I grew up loving art and thought for a long time that I would pursue it in college and as a career. 
					After I enrolled at Northeastern University, I very suddenly changed my mind
					and switched my major to Computer Science.
					I always had an interest in coding and I decided that this was my chance to learn more about it.
					<br/><br/>
					<b>BEST.</b> <b>DECISION.</b> <b>EVER.</b>
					<br/><br/>
					Northeastern is known for its 5-year "co-op" program in which students complete 2-3 internships
					in fields related to their majors. 
					As a Computer Science major I have completed 2 totally awesome software-engineering co-ops and am currently 
					on my third and final (which is also totally awesome).
					<br/><br/>
					My first one was at Intuit in sunny San Diego, CA.
					I worked on Turbo Tax Online on the front-end and I ate lunch outside everyday 
					laughing at the thought of my peers shivering through the Boston winter.
					Just kidding, I ate outside with great respect and sympathy for those in colder climates.
					<br/><br/>
					My second co-op was at PowerAdvocate in Boston.
					I was a full-stack developer on several different products.
					It was super exciting to work with all parts of the application, including front-end, back-end, and testing.
					<br/><br/>
					I am currently working at HubSpot as a front-end developer on the Content Optimization System.
					I've been building features and pushing code everyday and I love every second of it.
					And yes, I also love the free candy. But who doesn't?

				<h2>Code</h2>
				<p>
					The front-end is where I'm at. 
					I think my love of art and design has something to do with that. 
					Pretty much all of my professional experience is with web applications but I have 
					also made a few local desktop apps here and there.
					<br/><br/>
					I am loving CoffeeScript at the moment and I've also done a ton of work in 
					Java, Python, C, HTML, CSS, SASS, Jade, Handlebars, JavaScript, Backbone.js, Spring, and ExtJS.
					<br/><br/>
					I had the pleasure of participating in the <a target="blank" href="http://hackbeanpot.com/">2014 HackBeanpot</a>. 
					My dear friend Rose and I created a web app called Split that lets you split (see where the name comes from??) 
					gas money on road trips. Just put in your starting point and destination and how many people the gas money 
					will be split between. 
					It will calculate the total gas cost based on the distance you're traveling and 
					the national average gas price AND THEN it will send Venmo charges to each person! 
					We won Best Use of APIs. Yay! 
					<br/><br/>
					Check it out along with other stuff I've made <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/tswartz/split"> here</a>

					I am also pursuing a minor in Art and Design. 
					I've always loved making art, whether it's in charcoal or on Adobe Illustrator. 
					A lot of the work shown below was made
