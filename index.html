					Hey there! My name is Talia Swartz. 
					I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. 
					I love front-end web development and bunnies. 
					I also love drawing stuff, primarily people and my shoes.
					The photo you see above is me hiking in Israel.
					It's the only cool photo of myself that I have.

				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					I was born to a spunky flamenco dancer and her stoic but tender-hearted bull-fighter husband in Barcelona.
					We lived above a convent and at night my father played guitar for us while my mother danced under the stars.
					<br/><br/>
					Pranked you! I was born in Palo Alto, CA.
					When I was 6 we moved to Baltimore, MD.
					Yes, <i>The Wire</i> was filmed there. And yes, I have seen <i>The Wire</i>.
					Have you seen <i>The Wire</i>? If not, you should.
					<br/><br/>
					I grew up loving art and thought for a long that I would pursue that in college and as a career. 
					After I enrolled at Northeastern University, I very suddenly changed my mind
					and switched my major to Computer Science.
					I always had an interest in coding and I decided that this was my chance to learn more about it.
					<br/><br/>
					<b>BEST.</b> <b>DECISION.</b> <b>EVER.</b>
					<br/><br/>
					Northeastern is known for its 5-year "co-op" program in which students complete 2-3 internships
					in fields related to their majors. 
					As a Computer Science major I have completed 3 totally awesome software-engineering co-ops.
					<br/><br/>
					My first one was at Intuit in sunny San Diego, CA.
					I worked on Turbo Tax Online on the front-end and I ate lunch outside everyday 
					laughing at the thought of my peers shivering through the Boston winter.
					Just kidding, I ate outside with great respect and sympathy for those in colder climates.
					<br/><br/>
					My second co-op was at PowerAdvocate in Boston.
					I was a full-stack developer on several different products.
					It was awesome to work with all parts of the application, including front-end, back-end, and testing.
					I also got the opportunity to be part of a Scrum team where I learned a ton about working as part of a team.
					<br/><br/>
					I am currently on my third and final co-op at HubSpot as a front-end developer on the 
					Content Optimization System.
