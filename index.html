					Hey there! My name is Talia Swartz. 
					I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. 
					I love front-end web development and bunnies. 
					I also love drawing stuff, primarily people and my shoes.
					The photo you see above is of me hiking in Israel.
					It's the only cool photo of myself in existence.

				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					I was born to a spunky flamenco dancer and her stoic but tender-hearted bullfighter husband in Barcelona.
					We lived above a convent and at night my father played guitar for us while my mother danced under the stars.
					<br/><br/>
					Pranked you! I was born in Palo Alto, CA.
					When I was 6 we moved to Baltimore, MD.
					Yes, <i>The Wire</i> was filmed there. And yes, I have seen <i>The Wire</i>.
					Have you seen <i>The Wire</i>? If not, you should go watch it now. No, seriously, go. I'll wait here.
					<br/><br/>
					I grew up loving art and thought for a long time that I would pursue it in college and as a career. 
					After I enrolled at Northeastern University, I very suddenly changed my mind
					and switched my major from Digital Art to Computer Science.
					I always had an interest in coding and I decided that this was my chance to learn more about it.
					<br/><br/>
					<b>BEST.</b> <b>DECISION.</b> <b>EVER.</b>
					<br/><br/>
					Northeastern is known for its five-year "co-op" program in which students complete two or three internships
					in fields related to their majors. 
					As a Computer Science major I have completed two totally awesome software-engineering co-ops and am currently 
					on my third and final (which is also totally awesome).
					<br/><br/>
					My first one was at Intuit in sunny San Diego, CA.
					I worked on Turbo Tax Online on the front-end and the Mexican food there is unbelievable. 
					It was my first programming job ever so it was pretty cool to apply what I had learned in class in real life. 
					I learned a ton about coding for real users. And skipping out on the harsh Boston winter didn't hurt either.  
					<br/><br/>
					My second co-op was at PowerAdvocate in Boston.
					I worked as a full-stack developer on several different products.
					It was completely awesome to work with all parts of the application, including front-end, back-end, and testing. 
					I was also part of a Scrum team, which was a great way to learn about collaborating with other engineers.
					<br/><br/>
					I am currently working at HubSpot in Cambridge, MA as a front-end developer on the Content Optimization System.
					I've been building features and pushing code everyday and I love every second of it. 
					Being part of such a fast-growing company and helping it grow a little bit everyday feels amazing.
					The open and laid-back culture here is incredible and yes, I also love the free candy. 
					But who doesn't? Weirdos. That's who.

				<h2>Code</h2>
				<p>
					The front-end is where I'm at. 
					I think my love of art and design has something to do with that. 
					Pretty much all of my professional experience is with web applications but I have 
					also made a few local desktop apps here and there.
					<br/><br/>
					I am loving CoffeeScript at the moment and I've also done a lot of work in 
					Java, Python, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, Sass, Jade, Handlebars, JavaScript, Backbone.js, Flex, Spring, and ExtJS.
					<br/><br/>
					I also participted in the <a target="blank" href="http://hackbeanpot.com/">2014 HackBeanpot</a>. 
					My dear friend Rose and I created a web app called Split that lets you split (see where the name comes from??) 
					gas money on road trips. Just put in your starting point and destination and how many people the gas money 
					will be split between. 
					It will calculate the total gas cost based on the distance you're traveling and 
					the national average gas price AND THEN it will send Venmo charges to each person! 
					We won Best Use of APIs. Yay! 
					<br/><br/>

				<h2>Art</h2>
				<p>
					I'm also pursuing a minor in Art and Design. 
					I love making art, whether it's with digital or traditional media. 
					I've also done some graphic design work on the side for my synagogue, Johns Hopkins University, and my family and friends. 
					Posters, flyers, brochures, logos, you name it. 
					Take a look at some of my work below! (Click on the thumbnails to see the full images)
