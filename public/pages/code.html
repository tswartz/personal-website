			The front-end is where I'm at.

			I think my love of art and design has something to do with that. 
			Pretty much all of my professional experience is with web applications but I have 
			also made a few local desktop apps here and there.
			I am loving CoffeeScript at the moment and I've also done a lot of work in 
			Java, Python, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, Sass, Jade, Handlebars, JavaScript, Backbone.js, Flex, Spring, and ExtJS.
			<br/><br/>
			I participated in the <a target="blank" href="http://projects.hackbeanpot.com/2014-projects.html">2014 HackBeanpot</a> with my dear friend Rose. 
			We created a web app called Split that lets you split (see where the name comes from??) 
			gas money on road trips.
			We won Best Use of APIs. Yay!
