			My name is Talia Swartz and I live in Boston, MA.
			I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.hubspot.com" target="blank">HubSpot</a>.
			I went to Northeastern University where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
			I love front-end development and bunnies. 
			I also minored in Art & Design and I love to draw stuff - primarily people, kitchen things, and my shoes.
