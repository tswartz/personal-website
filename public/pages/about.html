		<p> 
			I'm a Computer Science major in my senior year at Northeastern University.
			I'll be working as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.hubspot.com" target="blank">HubSpot</a> after I graduate in Spring 2015.
			I love front-end development and bunnies. 
			I'm also an Art + Design minor and I love to draw stuff - primarily people, kitchen things, and my shoes.
