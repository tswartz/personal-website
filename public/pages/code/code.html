			The front-end is where I'm at. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I think my love of art and design has something to do with that. 
			Pretty much all of my professional experience is with web applications - 
			primarily on the front-end but I also have a good deal of full-stack experience.
			I've done a lot of work in 
			CoffeeScript, Java, Python, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, Sass, Jade, Handlebars, JavaScript, Backbone.js, AngularJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Flex, Spring, and ExtJS.
			<br/><br/>
			I participated in the <a target="blank" href="http://projects.hackbeanpot.com/2014-projects.html">2014 HackBeanpot</a> with my best homie Rose. 
			We created a web app called Split that lets you split (see where the name comes from??) 
			gas money on road trips.
			We won Best Use of APIs. Yay!
